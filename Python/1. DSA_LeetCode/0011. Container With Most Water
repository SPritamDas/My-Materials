11. Container With Most Water
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
Notice that you may not slant the container.


Intution:
2points opposite direction. Move that which is less.

class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        l = 0
        r = len(height) - 1
        max_ = 0
        while l < r:
            cap = min(height[l], height[r]) * (r - l)
            if cap > max_:
                max_ = max(max_, cap)
            if height[l] < height[r]:
                l += 1
            else:
                r -= 1         
        return max_
