392. Is Subsequence
Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.
A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Example 1:
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false

Intution:
If fist letter of substring matched, remove that and continue for 2nd.

class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        for r in range(len(t)):
            if len(s) == 0:
                return True 
            elif t[r] == s[0] and len(s)>0:
                s = s[1:]
                if len(s)==0:
                    break
        return len(s)==0
