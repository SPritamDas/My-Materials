# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Overview
**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** are specialized deep learning models designed for processing structured grid data, such as images and sequences. They excel in tasks like image classification, object detection, and natural language processing by automatically detecting patterns and features in the data.

## Architecture
CNNs consist of various layers, including:
- **Convolutional Layers**: Apply filters to capture spatial hierarchies and patterns.
- **Activation Layers**: Typically use the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function to introduce non-linearity.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce dimensionality through downsampling (e.g., Max Pooling).
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Connect every neuron in one layer to every neuron in the next, often serving as the final classification layer.

### Training
- **Method**: Trained using backpropagation alongside a loss function.
- **Objective**: Adjust filters and weights based on the error between predicted and actual outputs.

### Applications
CNNs are widely used in:
- Image and video recognition
- Medical image analysis
- Natural language processing
- Object detection

## Types of CNN Topology

### 1D Convolutional Neural Networks
- **Definition**: Used for sequential data represented in a single dimension.
- **Examples**:
  - Time series analysis (e.g., stock prices, weather data)
  - Text data processing (e.g., sentiment analysis)
- **Architecture**: Uses convolutional layers that slide a filter across the input data to detect features in sequences.

### 2D Convolutional Neural Networks
- **Definition**: Designed for processing image data represented as two-dimensional grids (height x width).
- **Examples**:
  - Image classification
  - Object detection
- **Architecture**: Employs convolutional layers that apply filters over the height and width of the image to capture spatial hierarchies.

## What is Convolution?
**Convolution** is a mathematical operation fundamental to CNNs, used for feature extraction. It involves the following steps:

1. **Filter (Kernel)**:
   - A small matrix that slides over the input data to perform the convolution operation.
   - Typically has dimensions smaller than the input data.

2. **Sliding Window**:
   - The filter moves across the input data, applying the convolution operation at each position.
   - For 2D data, this involves sliding the filter horizontally and vertically.

3. **Element-wise Multiplication and Summation**:
   - At each position, the filter performs element-wise multiplication with the corresponding values in the input data.
   - The results are summed to produce a single output value.

4. **Feature Maps**:
   - The result of applying the filter creates a new matrix known as a feature map, highlighting the presence of specific features.

5. **Multiple Filters**:
   - Multiple filters are applied to the input data, each detecting different features, resulting in multiple feature maps.

## Summary of Convolution
- **Purpose**: A key operation in CNNs that aids in feature extraction.
- **Function**: Enables the network to learn patterns directly from raw input data.
