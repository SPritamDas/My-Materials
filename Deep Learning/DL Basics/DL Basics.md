# Deep Learning Overview

Deep Learning (DL) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It utilizes multiple layers of artificial neural networks (ANNs), progressively extracting higher-level features from raw input data.

## Key Concepts:
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**: Models composed of layers of neurons designed to simulate the human brain's structure and learning.
- **Multi-layer Architecture**: DL models consist of multiple layers (Input, Hidden, Output) that allow the model to learn abstract features from raw data.
- **Feature Extraction**: DL networks automatically extract hierarchical features, which makes them effective for handling complex tasks like image and speech recognition.

## ML vs. DL

| **Aspect**                | **Machine Learning (ML)**                                  | **Deep Learning (DL)**                            |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Structure**              | Typically uses shallow models (few layers)                 | Uses deep models (many layers)                    |
| **Feature Engineering**    | Requires manual feature extraction                        | Automatically extracts features from raw data     |
| **Data Requirements**      | Works well with smaller datasets                          | Requires large datasets for effective learning    |
| **Computation Power**      | Can run on standard hardware                               | Needs high computational power (GPUs/TPUs)        |
| **Interpretability**       | Often more interpretable with simpler models (e.g., SVM, Decision Trees) | Less interpretable due to complexity and depth    |
| **Performance**            | Good for simpler tasks (e.g., regression, classification)  | Excels at complex tasks (e.g., image recognition, NLP) |

## Types of Neural Networks

1. **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**:
   - The basic type of neural network used in various tasks like classification and regression.
   
2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**:
   - Primarily used for image and video processing, CNNs are excellent at detecting spatial hierarchies in visual data.

   - Designed for sequence data like time series and natural language processing, RNNs can process inputs of variable lengths.

4. **Autoencoders**:
   - Neural networks used for unsupervised learning tasks such as dimensionality reduction and anomaly detection. They consist of an encoder and a decoder with hidden layers smaller than the input layer.

5. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**:
   - A framework that pits two neural networks against each other to generate synthetic data, commonly used in image generation and style transfer.
